Venox is a cutting edge cryptocurrency, with many features not available in most other cryptocurrencies.
- Currently developing Mobile Proof-of-Stake, allowing you to earn rewards from your mobile device

- Anonymized transactions using zerocoin technology.
- Instant transactions featuring guaranteed zero confirmation transactions, PIVX named it _SwiftX_.
- Decentralized blockchain voting providing for consensus based advancement of the current Masternode
